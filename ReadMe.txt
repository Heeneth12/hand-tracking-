Hand tracking model using Mediapipe pipeline
Media pipe is a Framework for building machine learning pipelines
for processing time-series data like video, and audio.
Recognizes the number of fingers opened using the hands' solution
in the Mediapipe library by google without using TensorFlow in 
Python
As far as research, this is the simplest way in which this can be done
The aim of the work is to implement a program code of an application 
for a computer with a digital camera, which provides image transmission
and hand gesture recognition
The created program can be improved in terms of the quality of the model
